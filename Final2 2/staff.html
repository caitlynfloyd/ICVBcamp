                    <p>Johan Dulfer assumed the role of Head Coach at Ithaca College in March of 2016 after a decade long run of unparalleled success at Clarkson University. In only his second year at the helm, coach Dulfer saw his Bombers enjoy an outstanding 2017 with a 25-9 record, their first-ever Liberty League championship, and a magical run through the NCAA tournament that saw them advancing all the way to the Final Four. It was the deepest post season run in the 50-year program history.</p>
                    <p>Coach Dulfer has been lucky to have coached some tremendously successful teams. In his 10 years at Clarkson, coach Dulfer orchestrated the turnaround of the Golden Knight program into a National Powerhouse. Clarkson qualified for 7 straight NCAA tournament appearances on his watch, and reached the Elite Eight 4 times in that time span (2012-2015).</p>
                    <p>Coach Dulfer believes that to create extraordinary results, you have to be willing to think -and train- outside the box. His teams are known for their high volleyball IQ, and their passionate approach to the game. Coach Dulfer was voted the Liberty League coach of the year 4 times and the New York regional coach of the year 3 times as his teams put together the most dominant resume of any team in the country in the past 4 seasons.</p>
                    <p>Coach Dulfer has coached over 15 All Americans as well as 2 Academic All Americans. Some of them started their careers by coming to the same summer camp you are thinking about signing up for!</p>

                    <p>Alesia Vaccari became the head coach at Brandeis University in June of 2014. Prior to coming to Brandeis, Alesia was the head coach at Simmons College where she posted a 50-49 record with the Sharks.

                    <p>Coach Vaccari worked with coach Dulfer at Clarkson University, bringing the University its first-ever Liberty League championship in 2009 and advancing to the NCAA tournament. Coach Vaccari and Coach Dulfer were the 2010 Liberty League coaching staff of the year.</p>
                    <p>Alesia is a former All-American setter at Springfield College, where her name is all over the record books. The same competitive fire that made coach Vaccari an All-American, is pushing Brandeis closer and closer to the top of the powerful UAA conference.

                    <p>Coach Klopfer assisted the program to a 21-8 record in her debut on South Hill in 2018, helping the program capture a second consecutive NCAA Regional Championship and berth to the NCAA Quarterfinals. Four student-athletes earned All-Liberty League praise under her tutelage, including sophomore right-side hitter Reagan Stone capturing Liberty League Performer of the Year honors. Three Bombers went on to earn AVCA All-Region praise in Stone, junior setter Caitlyn Floyd, and senior middle hitter Katie Evans. Stone and Floyd went on to earn Second- and Third-Team All-America honors, the first time the program has posted multiple All-Americans on one of the three teams since 1995.</p>
                    <p>Klopfer joined the program after spending two seasons as the head coach of Onondaga Community College’s women’s volleyball program for the past two seasons. Taking over the program in 2016 after serving as an assistant coach during the 2015 campaign, Klopfer led the Lazers to a 48-19 record during her two seasons in charge. She also helped guide six players to All-Conference honors, four to All-Region accolades, while she had one MSAC Player of the Year and one MSAC Defensive Player of the Year honoree during her time with the program. She will be Ithaca’s new assistant coach, taking the role of former assistant Kaley Vogel, who moved on following two excellent seasons with the program in 2016 and 2017.</p>
